This project is a bookstore web application developed during my internship at FPT Software. It was built by a team of three members as a learning and practice exercise in full-stack web development.

🔧 Project Overview
The website simulates a basic online bookstore, providing users with features such as:

Shopping Cart

My main contributions to the project included:

✅ User authentication (Sign up, Forgot Password)

✅ UI/UX design for the homepage

✅ Cart functionality

✅ Book category filtering

✅ Book search engine

⚙️ Tech Stack
