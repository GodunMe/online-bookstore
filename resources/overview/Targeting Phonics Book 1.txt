  <p>
    <strong>Pascal Press</strong> is excited to announce the release of the new <strong>Targeting Phonics</strong> series, developed to support studentsâ€™ practice of explicit phonics instruction aligned with their classroom teaching.
  </p>

  <p>
    Targeting Phonics uses a <strong>systematic synthetic phonics</strong> approach that follows the recommended teaching progression from the <strong>Australian and NSW Curriculums</strong>. This approach ensures consistency and effectiveness in literacy development.

  <p>
    A unique feature of this series is the <strong>sound card page</strong>, which includes a <strong>QR code</strong> linking to mini video clips. These videos provide an <strong>audio component</strong> to help students hear and learn correct pronunciation of sounds.
