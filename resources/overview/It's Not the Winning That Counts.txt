  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    From footballers who kicked wide to avoid scoring unfairly, to a yachtsman who abandoned victory to save a rival, and even tennis legend Jimmy Connors who double faulted in a Grand Slam final to restore fairness—these stories reflect the noble spirit still alive in sports.

    In an age of theatrics, fouls, and controversy, author <strong>Max Davidson</strong> honors the white knights of the sporting world—from David Beckham to Freddie Flintoff, Jesse Owens to Muhammad Ali.
