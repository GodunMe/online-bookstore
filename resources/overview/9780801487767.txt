    Widely acclaimed for its clarity and rigor, this book has become a foundational resource in the field. As <em>American Political Science Review</em> praised: “Every once in a while a book appears that treats the leading issues of a subject in such a clear and challenging manner that it becomes central to understanding that subject. <strong>Universal Human Rights in Theory and Practice</strong> is just such a book.”
