  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Raw, rebellious, and relentlessly driven — Dane Swan is one of AFL’s most iconic and unconventional legends. Drafted at pick 58, few predicted he would become a Brownlow Medallist, All-Australian five times over, and a Collingwood great. Known as much for his tattoos and attitude as his unmatched ball-winning ability, Swan was a ball magnet who played the game on his own terms.

With honesty and grit, he reveals the pride that fueled his rise, his loyalty to teammates, and the unconventional path that made him a champion.
