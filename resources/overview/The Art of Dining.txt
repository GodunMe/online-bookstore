  <h2 style="color: #8B4513;">A Rich Social History of British Cooking and Eating</h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>A remarkable and immersive journey</strong> into the culinary customs of Britain through the ages, this book 
    delves behind the curious ingredients and mysterious language of old cookbooks to reveal a world vastly different from 
    today’s kitchens.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In eras where food we now take for granted was scarce or unknown, and where preparation and preservation demanded 
    immense skill and labor, dining was not just about nourishment but a reflection of <strong>social attitudes and customs</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spanning the <strong>medieval and early Tudor, Elizabethan, Stuart, Georgian, Victorian, and Edwardian periods</strong>, the book 
    includes historical recipes alongside their modern adaptations, offering readers a practical and engaging way to 
    connect with the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Author <strong>Sara Paston-Williams</strong> draws on the rich records and kitchens of National Trust houses to paint a vivid 
    picture of Britain’s evolving food culture—from the cavernous, fire-lit kitchens of the Middle Ages to the 
    technologically advanced service areas of the Victorian era.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether the food was destined for ornate dining rooms or cozy parlors, the rituals of preparation and dining speak 
    volumes about the lives and values of those who came before us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Includes a handy conversion chart</strong> and is richly illustrated—a true feast for the eyes and the curious mind.
