  <p><strong>Enjoy rice and other grains every day</strong> with over 70 delicious, creative recipes that highlight the flavors, textures, and nourishing power of these versatile ingredients.</p>

  <p>Grains are the seeds of cereal crops grown around the world. Wholegrains consist of three parts: the fibre-rich bran, the nutrient-dense germ, and the starchy endosperm. The most familiar is rice—long-grain, short-grain, parboiled, brown—but this book invites you to explore the world of specialty varieties too: <em>Basmati, Jasmine, Japonica, Bomba, Arborio, Carnaroli</em>, and more.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond rice, discover recipes using <em>Amaranth, Barley, Buckwheat, Bulghur, Corn, Farro, Kamut, Millet, Oats, Quinoa, Rye</em>, and <em>Spelt</em>. Each grain brings its own texture and character to a diverse collection of dishes.</p>
