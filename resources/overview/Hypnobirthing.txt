    In <em>This Book Will Make Your Birth Better</em>, Siobhan demystifies hypnobirthing and reveals how it can help make any birth experience calmer, more comfortable, and more positive.

    You’ll learn how your body works on a muscular and hormonal level during labor, and how simple relaxation techniques can help you work with your body — not against it — for a more efficient and empowering birth. Siobhan’s down-to-earth approach dispels myths, replaces fear with facts, and offers a mindset shift that helps women feel informed, in control, and genuinely excited about giving birth.
